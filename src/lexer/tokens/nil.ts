/**
 * NIL Token
 *
 * From the spec:
 * > The special form "NIL" represents the non-existence of a particular
 * > data item that is represented as a string or parenthesized list, as
 * > distinct from the empty string "" or the empty parenthesized list ().
 * >
 * > > Note: NIL is never used for any data item which takes the
 * > > form of an atom.  For example, a mailbox name of "NIL" is a
 * > > mailbox named NIL as opposed to a non-existent mailbox
 * > > name.  This is because mailbox uses "astring" syntax which
 * > > is an atom or a string.  Conversely, an addr-name of NIL is
 * > > a non-existent personal name, because addr-name uses
 * > > "nstring" syntax which is NIL or a string, but never an
 * > > atom.

 * This second special case about an atom
